This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python

    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples:

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or
        { "type": "number", "value": 125 }

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples:

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples:

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python

import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples:

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or
        { "type": "number", "value": 125 }
        or
        { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) }
        or

```

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples:

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or
        { "type": "number", "value": 125 }
        or
        { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) }
        or
        { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }
    """
```

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or
        { "type": "number", "value": 125 }

```

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

User: if maritalstatus is ‘Never-married’ set evermarried2 to 'No', otherwise 'Yes
</conversation>

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or
        { "type": "number", "value": 125 }

```

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python

    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples:

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or
        { "type": "number", "value": 125 }

```

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples:

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:

    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples:

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples:

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```

This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }

```

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```
